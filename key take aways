This commit shows the difference between the path and exact path

Try changing the routes

http://localhost:5173/
http://localhost:5173/post

The page renders only home. To get rid of this behaviour use the attribute exact in front of the path.

The routes are like water fall. It goes to the route with the first matched character (in this case '/' only). 
That is the reason why it always renders the 'Home'
